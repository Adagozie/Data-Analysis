Over the years, Social Buzz’s customer base has grown astronomically, and they lack the internal resources to handle it.

Social Buzz has reached over 5 million active users with over 100,000 contents daily. These contents are unstructured, 
and they lack the skills and technology to manage and maintain it. 

Because they lack the skill & technology, they can’t analyze the data which means they cannot identify trends that would help 
them make informed decisions. So they decided to enlist the help of Accenture and as a Data Analyst Lead at Accenture, this is
where i come in to assist with their data challenges.
